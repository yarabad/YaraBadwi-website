  <p>
    The episode starts with introducing the main characters, the mother cooking in the kitchen, the father watching soccer, Sofia is working out, Luna is doing an experiment in her room, Parla is painting and Ella is colouring in her colouring book in Luna’s room. This is where the story begins.Ella starts to fight with her sister Parla for not helping her while colouring because Parla was busy painting. She starts crying out loud and gets upset with her sisters. When Luna leaves her room, Oreo, the cat comes to check what Luna was doing. She starts to smell the place and drops the chemicals on the floor by mistake. The liquid chemicals leak toward the colouring book that is on the floor. The book turns to show some bright lights coming out of it. It flips the pages fast as if there is a lot of wind. The book turns out to be a magic book.   
   Ella and the cat look so shocked then look at each other and Ella smiles at Oreo. They found something new to play with. Ella is the only one that can understand oreo in the whole family. Ella decides to look through the book so she opens the first page and sees that there are brief instructions (drawings help her understand)  that tells her what to do to go through the different worlds and the rules to go out of it again. Instructions are asking her to complete the puzzle in the last page by going to different places and finding the pieces.  She should open a page and leave the book on a surface then try to jump on it. And to go out again they need to find the book again in the different worlds using help from different world’s creatures. 
   She decides to try it but she tells Oreo that she wants this book to stay as a secret between them both and that they have to hide it after.  She opens the book on a random page and holds Oreo then closes her eyes and jumps. The first time she jumps it doesn’t work so they feel disappointed then she tries it again. Afterall, she finds herself suddenly in a place that she doesn’t know. A place full of candy, ice cream, chocolate and lollipops.
They are amazed.   
      Ella : “ This should be my happiest day ever!” she says while her eyes are wide open, looking around herself. “ I’ve never been in such a heaven before”. 
They start walking and walking. They eat from the ice cream trees and chocolate waterfall. 
Then Oreo looks at Ella and tries to explain to her that they need to find the puzzle and the book to go back. They continue walking until they find a small candy house. They decide to check it, maybe the piece of puzzle and the book is there. 
“ Hoooohoooo, Is anyone here? Can I come in? “ Says Ella while knocking the door. 
“ Ok Oreo, let's find that piece. “ She pushes the door and goes in, starts looking around herself. Everything is made up of candy. Then suddenly out of nowhere .. A LOUD voice comes from her back.     “ Are you looking for someone??”.   Ella screams out and gets scared.
Then she turns back and sees a donut that is talking to her. She starts laughing no stopping.
“ Are you… hhhh.. Are you a Donut??” Ella says, continue to laugh. 
Mr. Donuts get mad and say “ Stop Laughing please!”. 
“ Ohhh who is that Mr. Donuts? “, a soft lady voice comes closer. 
Ms. Cupcake comes into the house and looks at Ella and Oreo and says “ people? And a cat?” she sounds shocked. 
Ms. Cupcake asks Ella about what they are looking for and how they can help them with that. Ella says that they are looking for the piece of the puzzle that she needs to solve in her book. And that they might find the book that let them go back home with it. 
Ms. Cupcake says “ Ohh, this is weird, where would you find that?”. She starts thinking of a place that the puzzle’s piece can be in. And she remembered something. 
“ Ah, I found it!” Ms. Cupcake states. “ The Sour Kingdom”. She starts explaining to Ella about the sour kingdom that has all the most sour candies in the world and that their king is sour and not nice. But Ella wanted to go anyway. 
On their way to the sour kingdom they hear a sound of something weird between the ice cream trees. Ella gets scared and starts to move backward slowly. Then Macaron appears out of the bushes. All his face is ice cream and looks at them, “ Oww, Mr. donuts, Ms. Cupcake? What are you doing here?” talking while he was trying to eat the rest of the ice cream that was on his face. 
Another woman's voice came out : “ Macaron, oh my god stop eating that please.” Ms. Croissant says while walking toward them “ Ah! Sorry. Hello I am Ms. Croissant, responsible for the bakery in this beautiful kingdom. “ introduces herself to them. "Where are you all going?” 
“ To the Sour kingdom!” Ella says. Ms. Croissant looks at Ms cupcake and Mr. Donuts and asks why. They explain for her what they are looking for and that they are trying to help them go back home safely. 
Ms. Croissant tells them that she can’t come with them because she is baking a magic chocolate cake and she needs to leave but she asks them to take Macaron with them. 
They start walking until they reach the kingdom and they decide to enter undercover carefully. There are some sour soldiers on the door so they can’t go in. 
They began climbing and went inside. While Ella started to look around with Oreo to find it, Mr Donuts and Ms. Cupcakes were fighting because Mr. Donuts didn’t help Ms. Cupcake while climbing the kingdom and she feels that this is disrespectful. Ella thinks of how silly these people are when she has a bigger goal to run after. Macaron starts to look for something to eat. Oreo finds a cracked wood that she thought she needed to check under it. When she moved it, a vase fell down and the soldiers started to run toward the room they were in. Ella looks at Oreo and finds the puzzle’s piece beside her and she screams “Found it Found it! Thank you Oreo” she continues “ now we need to escape the place before they are here” 
She wanted to jump from the window. So Ella took the piece and the book they found and told them to jump one by one and that they need to help each other although they are upset. 
So Mr. Donuts help Ms. Cupcake jumped first and then helped them all while escaping and he jumped lastly. They saw the sour soldiers running toward them and they jumped after them but couldn’t reach them.  Ella, Oreo, Mr donuts, Ms. Cupcake and Macaron went back to their house. 
“ This was fun!” Said Macaron. 
“ HHHH I didn’t see you except eating,” responded Ella “ Thank you so much everyone, I am so happy to know you. Please Mr. Donuts, take care of Ms. Cupcake and always love each other. “ 
“Wait! You can’t leave without eating from my cake” says Ms Croissant entering the house with a cake in her hand. “ And you can take for you sisters as well” 
They ate the cake together then Ella and Oreo jumped back to the book and went back home. Ella gave the cake to her sisters and hugged them after their fight. 
The end!

    <h2 class="title">Summary </h2>
    <div class="cards">
        <p> The story continues for Ella to travel with her cat to different places and magic
             worlds through her book to continue the puzzle that is in the last page of the book. 
             Although Ella tries to convince herself and the audience that she is only going into 
             the different worlds because of the puzzle, she has a personal feeling toward that. She
              likes to travel to magic worlds and have friends with other creatures. The episodes give
               them lessons in real life, for example help, love, caring, and importance of family. Ella 
               continues to go to different worlds in the other episodes and try other adventures with 
               different world’s creatures. The first episode started by showing Ella with her book in 
               Luna's room and how the chemicals turned the book into a magic book. Moreover, everytime
                Ella and Oreo come back home they hide the book and continue their life as if nothing happened. 
            In one of the episodes, they will go to the snow world. They will get to know the snow king, and
             some other people from that world. They will have to look through for the piece of puzzle and the
              book to go back home and add the part of the puzzle in the book. 
        They will also be going to the fairyland where they will find fairies and have nice adventures. 
        There is also an environment that will be in one of the episodes that is the tree land. Everything will
         be made up of woods and trees. The people there are made up of wood and they live in tree houses. They
          will also be helping Ella and Oreo to find the puzzle’s missing part.
